Using the emacs syntax highlighter
----------------------------------

1) Get Emacs 24.1

2) Open a .cf file `C-x C-f FILENAME.cf'

3) Explicitly activate the mode `M-x cfengine3-mode' (M-x is Alt-x or
   Esc-x usually)

4) If you want it to always happen, add this to ~/.emacs:

(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist ("\\.cf\\'" . cfengine3-mode))

5) In 24.2 cfengine-mode will be aliased to cfengine3-mode, but for
   now it's aliased to cfengine-auto-mode, which tries to figure out if
   you're using 2 or 3 and defaults to 2.
