                       EXERCISE

Practice using "methods" type promises

Write a policy that has two bundles.

The first bundle does something visible (such as a
reports type promise that says "bundle1") AND calls
the second bundle.

The second bundle reports "bundle2".

Run your policy?  What output do you see and in what
order?  Why?


EXERCISE 10. Methods (continued).

Now parameterize the 2nd bundle -- have the
first bundle feed it an argument, and have the
2nd bundle display that argument.
