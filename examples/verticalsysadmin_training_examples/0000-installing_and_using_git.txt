Installing and Using Git
========================

The examples used in this class are kept in the GitHub version control service.

These examples are included in the CFEngine Community Code Sharing Repo ("Design Center")

Installing Git (for RHEL 5 systems)
-----------------------------------

rpm -ihv  http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm 

yum -y install git 



Using Git During Class
----------------------

# Download Aleksey's clone of the CFEngine Design Center
# (I don't have commit access to Design Center, so I've
# forked it and make changes in my own fork.  CFEngine
# pulls in my changes into the CFEngine Design Center repo.)

cd ~
mkdir git_atsaloli
cd git_atsaloli
git clone git://github.com/atsaloli/design-center.git

cd design-center

# Add Aleksey's repo as a remote repository, so you can
# download edits or additions made in class
 
git remote add upstream git://github.com/atsaloli/design-center.git

# Use 'git pull' to sync your local directory with Aleksey's repo
git pull upstream


Aleksey's examples are under
design-center/examples/verticalsysadmin_training_examples


Using Git After Class
---------------------

Switching to the CFEngine master repository:

cd ~
mkdir cfengine_repo
cd cfengine_repo
git clone git://github.com/cfengine/design-center.git
cd design-center
git remote add upstream git://github.com/cfengine/design-center.git
git pull upstream  # get the latest version from the upstream
